#RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR

1. This project was built scratch using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. I used For lop initially for my random number generator but struggled to get it under 15.
3. I decided to use while loop but struggled to make it unique (random), and that was because my other logical statements were outside the loop. This worked once i placed everything inside the loop.
4. I improved moreon my CSS using flexbox. My styling was also quite on point, especially when i had to style an empty p tag/element.
5. In the end i learnt a whole lot without even consulting any site.
